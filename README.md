Welcome!

This project attempts to summarize film screenplays using Transformer models.

- Data for screenplays generated using [Movie-Script-Database by Aveek-Saha](https://github.com/Aveek-Saha/Movie-Script-Database)
- Data for summarizations scraped from Wikipedia articles for corresponding movies
- Primary experimentations were done using T5 and LongT5 models.
